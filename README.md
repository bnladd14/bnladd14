### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub!
________________________________

My name is Brittany Ladd, and I'm a Software Engineer.
I also enjoy doing some web development as a hobby. On my GitHub,
you'll find a collection of public repositories with some examples
of my work. It includes some static web development along with
other projects in languages including Python, Fortran, and C++.

I hope you enjoy!
